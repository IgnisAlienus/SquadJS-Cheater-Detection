# Cheater report generator for SquadJS based on JetDave's Code

# THIS PLUGIN IS VERY MUCH IN A BETA STATE
- It does what I intended it to do but has some very much needed Quality of Life updates.

## What it do?
- At a configurable interval, this plugin will read your `SquadGame.log` for Suspected Cheaters.
- It checks configurable values such as `Explosions`, `ServerMoveTimeStampExpired`, and `Kills`.
- If any Suspected Cheaters are found, it pushes it to a configurable Discord Channel.

## Installation
- Add the bits to your SquadJS
- Set the Threshold to `0` to Disable one of the Detections.
